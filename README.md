# Adventurers-Guild-Tech-Demo
Early work for a Unity fantasy management sim.
## Description
This project began as a small management sim made for an itch.io game jam, but turned into a much more extensive project that I am continuing to expand. The game consists of hiring various adventurers, sending them out on quests, and building out the guild hall for them to live in. The art style is isometric pixel with all art assets created by me.

Currently only the basic foundations are in place for the most part, including the structure of creating the games map and the simulation AI for the adventurers.
## Planned Features
* Expanded Quests - Quests are planned to be much more detailed, with a wide variety of outcomes based on the adventurers that are sent on them.
* Expanded AI Behaviour - Increase the amount of things that adventurer's can do while in the guild hall, and the way they interact with eachother.
* VN Elements - The player will be able to talk to hired adventurer's as well as premade NPC's, building relationships with them and unlocking story events.
* Alignment System - As the world expands, different quests will have alignment with different factions, and the choices made on what quests to take and who to help will change what sort of quests you get, what adventurer's join your guild and what story elements will happen.
