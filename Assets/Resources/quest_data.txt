The farmer thanked him for his effort, but it was clear the {1} had more of a negative effect than a positive one.", "After a few wild chases, {0} managed to corner the beast and slow it down long enough for the farmer and his helpers to lasso the beast, returning it safely back behind closed gates.

The farmer thanked him with all sincerity for his efforts above and beyond what was asked of him.", "In an impressive display of agility and strength, {0} single-handedly chased after the bull through fields and hedgerows in pursuit until finally catching up with its lumbering form near a small streambed. The {1} then proceeded to tackle it into submission before binding the baying beast. Like something out of a folk tale, {0} carried the bull back to the farmer in his arms, with a smile on his face. The farmer's gratitude was beyond words, and {0} was rewarded handsomely for this Herculean effort." ],

Afterwards he was presented with several generous tips by other customers who wished him luck before departing!" ],
